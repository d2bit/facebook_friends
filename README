Create a ruby on rails app with:
- user model (do not use devise gem)
- ability for user to register & login with his Facebook account

Do not use omniauth gem or any other Facebook related gems, use standard http library.

Create a public GitHub repo and push your code to it. 

Create a Heroku app and deploy working application.

Expected behaviour:
User name and email should be saved to the users table at the registration time. 
Once the user is logged in he should be able to see 10 of his friends listed alphabetically.

Bonus points:
- Apply some css, make it look nice.
- Use Twitter bootstrap or zurb foundation to make page responsive (you can choose some other css framework if you wish)
